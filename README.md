# Hours Tracking
## Scenario
- The DFE has declared the need for a T-level placement hours tracker.
- This arises from too many inconsistencies across the country in how hours are tracked.
- The solution should be web-based and centralized for schools/trusts.

## Overview
- Design and build a centralized online system.
- This system will track and monitor the hours completed by students with business input.

## Trusts / Schools / Teachers
- The system should allow trusts, schools, teachers, and individual T-level subjects to be added (different subjects have different hour requirements).
- Students can be added by class teachers either individually or via CSV. Alternatively, school admins can add them via CSV and assign them to teachers.

## Teacher specifically
- Teachers can see approved and unapproved hours for each student.
- A messaging system between teachers and mentors is required (may mentor more than one student) â€“ this is optional.
- Teachers can see a class overview of placements, mentors, approved hours, and unapproved hours.

## School specifically
- School admins can see all courses in a school overview (similar to the teacher view but combined for the entire school).
- School admins add staff to the system.
- School admins add business and business mentor details, linking them to students.

## Trust specifically
- Trusts can see all T-levels in all schools under their administration (similar to teacher and school views but combined for all schools in the trust).
- Trust admins can add schools to the system.

## Student specifically
- Students log hours and must add a short log of activities undertaken (a diary of work completed).

## Business / mentor
- Businesses and mentors form part of the structure to allow monitoring of students in the business.
- Mentors approve hours submitted by their mentees.
- Mentors must be changeable due to employment demands and can see both previous mentors' approved hours and any current unapproved hours.
- Mentors can adjust clocked hours to correct discrepancies (e.g., late starts, extended lunch, sick leave).
- Businesses and mentors might be two separate individuals.
- Businesses can see all students on placement and approve hours too.
